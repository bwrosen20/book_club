Welcome to Brian's Book Club App!
The app is designed to handle a book club of any size, allowing members to search through the google book API and nominate a book for the club to read. The members will then all have the option to leave a review and vote for the next book.

The user is first directed to the login screen, where they have the option to log in or signup.

Upon signup or login, the user will be directed to the home page.

The home page lists all books the club has already read and options to filter and sort through them.
The user can also click on a book's thumbnail to see its information and reviews

Inside the book's display page (using The Martian as an example) the user is able to write, delete or edit only their own review.

The voting screen has 2 features.
 1. The user can vote on books that other club members have nominated (if there is no vote button below a book it is either the user's own  nomination or the user has already used his vote on the book)

  2a. Upon clicking a thumbnail, the user will have the opportunity to nominate the selected book. If they already have a nomination up, this      will replace their existing nomination

The current book page is a display page for the club's current book. It contains the added option to "begin next book" which will move the current book to the home page and move the book with the highest votes (tiebreaker is first to be added) to the current book page
