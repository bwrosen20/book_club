Welcome to Brian's Book Club App!
The app is designed to handle a book club of any size, allowing members to search through the google book API and nominate a book for the club to read. The members will then all have the option to leave a review and vote for the next book.

The user is first directed to the login screen, where they have the option to login or signup.
